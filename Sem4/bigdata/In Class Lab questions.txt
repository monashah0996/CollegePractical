#Dplyr In Class Exercise 
Produce a screen shot for every answer so we can go over towards the end or just keep the naswer in the r script file 
#Follow the below steps 

#first create a new  R file in Rstudio
#then install the below package 
install.packages("hflights")
#then load the dplyr library
library("dplyr")
# convert to local data frame
flights <- hflights
# test the filter using the below 
filter(flights, Month==1, DayofMonth==1)


#Question 1
# filter flights dataset by uniquecarrier equal to 'AA' or flightnum equal to 460 and Arrdelay > 5
# use | for OR condition



#Question 2
# select flights dataset the following variables year,month,dayofmonth and any other column that CONTAINS
# the 'Taxi' and 'Delay' using the contains function


#Question 3
# Using pipe method to select UniqueCarrier and DepDelay columns and then filter for delays over 60 minutes


#Question 4
#Using pipe method to select UniqueCarrier and DepDelay columns and then sort by DepDelay



#Question 5
# using pipe method select distance and airtime, create a new variable Speed(calculation of Distance divided by Airtime *60)
# Also filter where Airtime is Null 'NA' 


#Question 6
#using nesting and pipe and summarise for each carrier, calculate the percentage of flights cancelled or diverted
